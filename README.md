# Human gesture classification using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
The dataset used, consists of samples of dynamic sign language gestures. The gestures were recorded using Microsoft Kinect. Microsoft Kinect produces the 3D skeleton of the body with 20 joints. Thus, the data consists 60 (=20x3) dimensions. Each sign gesture is an ordered sequence of 20 joints representing their movement.
